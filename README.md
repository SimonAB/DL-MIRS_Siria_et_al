**The malaria parasite, which is transmitted by several
  _Anopheles_ mosquito species, requires more time to reach its
  human-transmissible stage than the average lifespan of mosquito vectors.
  Monitoring the species-specific age structure of mosquito populations is
  critical to evaluating the impact of vector control interventions on malaria
  risk. We developed a rapid, cost-effective surveillance method based on deep
  learning of mid-infrared spectra of mosquito cuticle that simultaneously
  identifies the species and age class of three main malaria vectors in natural
  populations. Using spectra from over 40,000 ecologically and genetically
  diverse _An. gambiae_, _An. arabiensis_, and _An. coluzzii_
  females, we developed a deep transfer learning model that learned and
  predicted the age of new wild populations in Tanzania and Burkina Faso with
  minimal sampling effort. Additionally, the model was able to detect the
  impact of simulated control interventions on mosquito populations, measured as
  a shift in their age structures. In the future, we anticipate our method can
  be applied to other arthropod vector-borne diseases.**
