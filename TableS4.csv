E1 - Reducing parameters
"Data from groups LV, GV, and EV."
4800 mosquito data points from group LV and 2400 mosquito data points from group GV in the training set.
Data from Tanzania and Burkina Faso only.
"Data balanced by country, species, and age groups for groups LV and GV."
Testing data set is group EV.
Consider how the number of trainable parameters in the model effects classification accuracy.
E2 - Cross EV
Data from groups GV and EV.
2400 mosquito data points from group GV in the training set and either 1200 data points from Tanzania or 300 data points from Burkina Faso from Group EV.
Data from Tanzania and Burkina Faso only.
"Data balanced by country, species, and age groups for groups GV. Data balanced by species, and age groups for groups EV."
Testing data set is data from the opposite country to that which was included during training from group EV.
Attempt to classify an unseen semi-field from group EV data from another country.
E3 - Cross laboratory
Data from group LV only.
8224 mosquito data points.
"Data balanced, where possible, by country, species, and age groups."
Leave data out from one country as the testing set in an attempt to classify data from an unseen lab.
E4 - Cross laboratory with reduced parameters
Data from group LV only.
Stage 1
"Initial training set is 3424 mosquito data points from UK group LV, balanced where possible by species, and age groups."
Sensitivity analysis performed on model from stage 1 to select frequencies.
Stage 2
"Training set is 2400 mosquito data points from either Tanzania or Burkina Faso in group LV, balanced by species, and age groups."
Testing data set is from group LV from the country left out during training.
